               <p>I went on a fabulous vacation trip to San Juan, Culebra and Vieques Puerto Rico and also to Curacao.  My trip included a walking tour of the El Yunque Rainforest in Puerto Rico as well as swimming with Turtles and Seahorses in Curacao.  The seafood was delicious and the three week vacation was the longest one that I ever took!<br />
